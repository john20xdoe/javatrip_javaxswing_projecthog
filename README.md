# Project Hog

An example project I designed and coded with Java and Swing. GUI design is created in photoshop by my teammate.
You can start Hog by clicking the `start Hog.bat` batch file, or running it on the command line as:  
      cd Hog/bin

      java Hog

### Usage:
Instructions are displayed on the Hog's main display panel.

### Notes:
The default PINs are:  
`PIN1 : 12345`  
`PIN2 : 54321`  
They are set in `./src/main/resources/HogStatus.txt`


This software is for demo-purposes only and provided "as is".
